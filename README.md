Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a tech field that involves design, development and maintenance of software systems. It helps to create software applications which are useful in other sectors like health, agriculture or entertainment.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages like C which are essential during coding.
Software engineering being established as a discipline in 1960s. 
The rise of agile methodologies in early 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The user needs and system requirements. I t is importatant to gather the user needs before development.
Design. The next step is to design the user interface according to user needs.
Implementation. Code is written here according to user specifications.
Testing. The design is tested to ensure it meets the right standards.
Deployment. The software is now released for the consumers to be able to access.
Maintenance. Providing updates and support to the software with time.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a systematic coding approach with distinct phases while Agile methodology is an iterative coding approach that focuses on flexibility and collaboration.
Waterfall works well where it involves one developer while agile is best for teams.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer is responsible for writing code. Quality assurance engineer ensures quality of a software by designing test plans. Project Manager oversees planning, execution and delivery of software products.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code.eg VS Code. VCS are for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members.eg Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Requirement changing during development cycle. They need to be flexible.
Tight deadlines can also be another challenge. Here they need to do proper planning to avoid last minute rush.
They also need to adopt agile methodologies during coding.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is for testing individual components or modules of software.
Intergation testing involves testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System testing is testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance testing is testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
All these ensure proper planning and avoidance of bugs during development process.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 
It helps you to get an exact and well defined response.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt: Teach me how to cook. correction: how do i cook rice beef.
the corrected one is more effective as it is clear and direct.
